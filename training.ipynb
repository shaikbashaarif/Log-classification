      " the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n",
      " share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n",
      " software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n",
      " GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n",
      " any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n",
      " your programs, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n",
      " price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n",
      " have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n",
      " them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n",
      " want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
      " free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
      " these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",
      " certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n",
      " you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
      " gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n",
      " freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n",

      "\n",
      "   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n",
      " (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n",
      " giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n",
      " that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n",
      " authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n",
      " changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n",
      " authors of previous versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n",
      " modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n",
      " can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n",
      " protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n",
      " pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n",
      " use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n",
      " have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n",
      " products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n",
      " stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n",
      " of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n",

      "   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n",
      " States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n",
      " software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n",
      " avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n",

      "\n",
      "   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n",

      "\n",
      "   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n",

      "   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n",
      " permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n",
      " infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n",
      " computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n",

      " rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n",
      "\n",
      "   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n",
      " convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n",
      " in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n",
      " of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n",
      " with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n",
      " the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n",
      " not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n",
      " for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n",

      " your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n",
      " the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n",
      " makes it unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n",
      " measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n",
      " 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n",
      " similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n",
      " measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n",
      " circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n",
      " is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n",
      " the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n",
      " modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n",
      " users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n",
      " technological measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n",
      " receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n",
      " appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n",

      "     \"keep intact all notices\".\n",
      "\n",
      "     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n",

      "     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n",
      "     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n",
      "     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n",
      "     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n",
      "     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n",
      "\n",
      "     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n",
      "     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n",
      "     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n",
      "     work need not make them do so.\n",

      " \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n",
      " used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n",

      "   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n",
      "\n",

      " in one of these ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n",

      "\n",
      "     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n",

      "     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n",
      "     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n",
      "     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n",
      "     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n",
      "     with subsection 6b.\n",
      "\n",
      "     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n",
